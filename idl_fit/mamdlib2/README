--------- Installation instruction ------------
To use the MAMDLIB you must 

1) Declare the environment variable MAMDLIB_DIR that 
points to the directory where the MAMDLIB is.
For example, in your .cshrc you would put the following line:

setenv   MAMDLIB_DIR $HOME/idl/mamdlib


2) Add the following lines in your idl_start (idl_startup) file.
It is important that you put these lines before the lines that
call the ASTRON library.

DEFSYSV, '!MAMDLIB_DIR', GETENV("MAMDLIB_DIR")
!path=!path+':'+ EXPAND_PATH('+'+!MAMDLIB_DIR)
mamdlib_init, 13     ; the number here is the color table number you want to use
